I am doing [Advent of Code 2021](http://adventofcode.com/2021).

I am also learning [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org).

I am also trying to code on Windows with [Sublime Text 4](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [GitSavvy](https://github.com/timbrel/GitSavvy).

# Learnings

* Kotlin is nice
* `val` and `var` are too similar, they're hard to distinguish at a glance
* Delayed initialization of `val`s is nice, but I wish it played a little better with loops (is the val initialized after the loop? Kotlin can't predict!)
* Man you can do some really dense neat stuff with transforms. I like the syntax, too.
* Every GitSavvy doc assumes you're already good at Git. Here's the workflow for non-Git folks:
  - ctrl-shift-P
  - "git: quick stage"
  - go to each file you want to commit and hit enter
  - after you've selected them all, go to "git: quick commit" and hit enter
  - type in a good commit message
  - ctrl-shift-P and "git: push" to push to Github
* `fold()`/`reduce()` on collections is fun and powerful
* When I go back to coding Go, I miss two things: `if`/`when` as expressions, and the always-on string templates.
